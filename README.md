# Visualizing High-Dimensional Data with Manifold Learning and Clustering

##  Overview
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing high-dimensional datasets using **manifold learning** and **clustering techniques**.  
The goal is to unfold hidden data structures and reveal intrinsic patterns through dimensionality reduction and visualization methods.

##  Key Techniques Used
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Isomap**
- **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
- **Spectral Embedding**
- **Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)**
- **t-SNE (2D and 3D Visualization)**
- **HDBSCAN Clustering**

##  Visualization Results
The following visualizations are generated:
- 3D View of Original Data  
- Dumb 2D Projection  
- PCA (2D and 3D)  
- Isomap, LLE, Spectral Embedding, and MDS  
- t-SNE (2D and 3D)  
- HDBSCAN Cluster Visualization  

Each visualization provides insights into how the data behaves in lower dimensions, showing how well various algorithms preserve local and global structures.
